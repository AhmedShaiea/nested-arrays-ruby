# Nested Arrays Ruby

## Objectives

1. Create nested arrays.
2. Read data from a nested array.
3. Write data to a nested array.
4. Understand iterating on nested arrays.

## Outline

1. Remind them about arrays. Arrays in ruby can contain objects of any type. Including even other arrays entirely.
2. A simple nested structure, an array within an array. Sort of pointless, but shows structure.
3. Demonstrate reading and writing with that simple nested array.
4. Real world nested arrays.
  - Example of structure, why nested is better
  - Example of reading and writing

5. Iterating of nested arrays
  - use real array examples and show how you'd iterate to deconstruct them.
  - read / write data into the inner arrays
  - iterate over the inner arrays themselves with a nested loop.

6. Complext nested arrays, 3-4 deep.
  - structure, reasoning
  - reading/writing/iteration (quick examples)
  - danger / not good to go past 3
